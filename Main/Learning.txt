For first, we need to understand what "compile" and "descompile" means.
Compile - transforming human-readable code into machine-readable.
Descompile - attempts to reverse this process, turning machine-readable code back into human-readable code.

For first try to make a basic snake game from nokia3310 in C++
But before that, we need to know these topics:
1. Setup and Environment
  - Ensure you have Termux set up with clang++ for compiling C++ code
2. Basic Syntax and Structure
  - Learn about variables, data types, operators, and basic input/output (IO) in C++
3. Control Flow
  - Understand if, else, for, while loops, switch statements
4. Functions
  - Define and use functions in C++, including function parameters and return values
5. Array and Strings
  - Work with arrays in C-style strings (char arrays) in C++
6. Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)
  - Introduction to classes, objects, constructors, and methods
7. Pointers and Memory Management
  - Learn about pointers, dynamic memory allocation (new, delete), and smart pointers (std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr)
8. Standart Template Library (STL)
  - Explore containers (e.g., std::vector,std::map) and algorithms povided by the STL.

Building the Snake Game
1. Setup
2. Game Board and Snake Movement
3. Food Generation and Collision Detection
4. Game Logic
5. User Input Handling
6. Rendering
7. Game Loop
8. Advanced Features (Optional)

SETUP
 - You have all setted up
 - If you didnt then, read the file "HERE"

-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
WRITING YOUR FIRST C++ PROGRAM
1. Open vim to create a new file
- vim hello.cpp

2. Press i to edit the file

3. Write or copy this program

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

- This program uses "iostream" to output "Hello World!" to the console

4. Save and exit vim
- Press Esc
- Type :wq
- Press enter
